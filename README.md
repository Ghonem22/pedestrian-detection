# pedestrian-detection
In this repo, I've used OpenCV to detect pedestrians. You will find two functions:

- First one is for detecting pedestrians from images

- Second one is for detecting pedstrians from streaming:

    This is used with a ropot that emits ultraviolit rays to sterilize hospitals, So I wanted the ropot to stop if there is any human.
    So I setup a delay, u can remove the delay if you want to run the camera vedio normally without any delay.
